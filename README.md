# You did this on Nov 12, 2015
# On Nov 17, 2015, your status at RHUL showed Department of Physics - Postgraduate research student, 21/09/15 â†’ 21/01/16
# What made you into a postpostgraduate?
# Getting stuck running away from what yoo did to me is sad and pathetic
# Doing that knowing how much you're hurting me and harming me is reprehensible unconscionable, fucked up and utterly dickish
# You need to do right by me
# You lured me into that relationship and constantly encouraged me
# You constantly told me how strong your feelings were for me and how much I meant to you
# And then you just threw me away in as callous and cruel a way as possible
# You evidenced not a hint of remorse, said you didn't care
# And you haven't cared what you did to me for all of these 8 1/2 years
# That makes you ....  I'm tired of writing all the terms for how fucked up you and your behaviour have been
# How much longer do you want ot keep running away?
# You'll never get away from what you did to me
# You're running away fromn *yourself*
# I don't deserve to be treated this way
# 8 1/2 years you have diminished my life
# You've made virtually every day into a grim ordeal
# And so far, there's no reason to think you care
# I'm tired of you hurting me for such petty and selfish reasons
# The magnitude of the damage and pain you've caused me means I have a tremendous leeway in what I can do and what it might do to you 
# Nothing I've done so far, added all up together comes close to out of bounds
# Nothing I could do would come close to damaging you the way you have damaged me and *you* would deserve it, unlike me 
# My only option is to make it as costly as I can for you to keep ignoring me
# You still have a few days left before my new efforts to heal myself begin
# You could, as always, end this nightmare by doing what you should have done 8 1/2 yeas ago--treat me with the respect and compassion I deserved
# FFS, look at the price I paid for loving you and believing what you said to me
